    <h1>Geometry of Physics</h1>

    <p>
        This is a reading group with the physics student union (PhySU) at the University of Toronto that 
        I am conducting for students who are interested in mathematical physics. It
        covers the main geometry that is used in the subject. We intend on covering the following topics:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>A breif introduction to Group Theory</li>
        <li>A breif introduction to Topology</li>

    <p>
        Here are the handwritten lecture notes with a breif desciption of what they cover. I am currently (as of January 26, 2026) working on typing these up as well
        and when I am done, I will post them here. One can find problem sheets at the bottom. Finally I want to mention that I am recording the meetings
        of this reading group and they can be found on my youtube <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLj2YyVu4756zW9M6Rp9Hh2VumwZefcRlt">here</a>.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 1.pdf">Lecture 1</a> - We talked about what I want to cover. 
            The definition of a group, some classical groups, some examples of groups used in physics and examples of how symmetries 
            correspond to conservation laws. What group homomorphism are. Definition of representations.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 2.pdf">Lecture 2</a> - We talked the definition of a group 
            action, recapped the definition of representations, talked about quantum spin \(\frac{1}{2}\)-particles and the 
            Stern-Gerlach experiments, the pauli matrices, talked about how to embed \(\R^3\) in a matrix space and introduced 
            the action of \(\textrm{SU}(2)\) on \(\R^3\) via conjugations (spin action)
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 3.pdf">Lecture 3</a> - We talked about and motivated the 
            definition of a topological space (open and closed sets), sequences and convergence in a topological space, 
            properties of topological spaces such as T2, 2nd countable and compact. Furthermore we introduced the notation 
            of a continuous map. We introduced the notion of a topological manifold. Finally we introduced an intimate connection 
            between pointed topological spaces and groups via the (first) fundamental group functor.

        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 4.pdf">Lecture 4</a> - We talked about and motivated the 
            definition the definitions of Bosonic and Fermionic exchange statistics we see in 3 dimensions. We talked about the
             fundamental group. We defined (the ordered and unordered) configuration spaces and how the fundamental group of the 
             unordered fundamental group has a natural action on state space that induces exchange statistics. Finally, we talked about 
             the allowed unitary scalar representations of the groups \(S_n\) and \(B_n\) and how these lead to the theoretical 
             existence of Anyons.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 5.pdf">Lecture 5</a> - We talked about tensor products of 
            general vector spaces. We saw various isomorphisms between vector spaces and their duals. We say how we can talk about 
            tensor product spaces as multiparticle states and multilinear maps. We found the transformation laws for the tensors and 
            their components. We motivated why we want to talk about maps like the determinant.
        </li>   
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 6.pdf">Lecture 6</a> - We talked about the complexification 
            of a vector space and we also defined an almost complex struture on even dimensional real vector spaces. We saw how the 
            notion of complex and almost complex on vector spaces is the same. We further talked about the alternation map and defined 
            the wedge product on the space of forms. We talked about inner products in a more general setting and we defined an extension
             of an inner product onto the various tensor spaces. We finally defined the Hodge star operator on the space of k-forms.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 7.pdf">Lecture 7</a> - We talked about Hilbert space, 
            Banach spaces, symmetric tensors and the symmetric product. We also talked about how symmetric tensors are homogenous 
            polynomials of vector spaces. Finally we talked about vector valued tensors and Lie algebras.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 8.pdf">Lecture 8</a> - We talked about why calculus is defined
             over the reals and not the rationals, this gave us motivation to then restrict ourselves to complete spaces with norms 
             (in other words Banach spaces). We then defined the derivative of a banach space valued curve and used it to generalize 
             to the case of directional derivatives called Gâteaux variations. We used this to define the Gâteaux derivative of a map 
             between arbitrary banach spaces. We then discussed how this notion is too weak and gave an example of a Gâteaux 
             differentiable function that is not continuous. We used this to define Frechét derivatives and we defined functions of 
             class \(C^n\). We concluded with the three main(hard) theorems of Frechét calculus that prove to use their use. 
             These were the chain rule, inverse function theorem and the implicit function theorem.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 9.pdf">Lecture 9</a> - We motivated the need for integration
             in many dimensions through looking at the work done by a force along a certain path. We then tried to talk about flux 
             through a surface and ran into the problem of integration over \(\R^2\). We then motivated why the Riemann integral does not 
             suffice for physics through an example by Henri Lebesgue. This then lead us to the notation of measure spaces and the 
             notation of a measure. We defined the Borel sigma algebra of a topological space and defined the Lebesgue sigma algebra 
             of \(\R^n\).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 10.pdf">Lecture 10</a> - We developed the theory of Lebesgue 
            integration of measureable functions on sigma finite measure spaces. We talked about \(L^p\) spaces. We also talked about the 
            Monotone Convergence Theorem (MCT) and the Dominated Convergence Theorem (DCT).
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 11.pdf">Lecture 11</a> - We further developed the theory of 
            Lebesgue integration on sigma finite measure spaces. We talked about the product measure, iterated integrals and saw how to 
            compute integrals over product spaces using Tonelli's and Fubini's Theorem.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 12.pdf">Lecture 12</a> - We saw how to integrate over surfaces
             in 2d. Moreover we say that all the theorems that look like FTC follow the exact same pattern which gives us motivation 
             to strive towards a generalization of these. Moreover we say that a lot of the constructions in specific dimensions seem 
             arbitrary and use the dimensionality of the space a lot.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 13.pdf">Lecture 13</a> - We introduced the ideas of catgory 
            theory and give the basic definitions. We saw how categories are already things we have seen before and we gave a lot of 
            examples of various categories. We defined the idea of a functor and natural transformation, though we will not really need 
            to know what natural transformations are. We formalized the idea of a dual object using the opposite category.
        </li>   
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 14.pdf">Lecture 14</a> - We introduced the idea of smooth
            manifolds. We gave examples of smooth manifolds and defined smooth maps on these objects.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 15.pdf">Lecture 15</a> - We introduced the ideas of tangent 
            vectors, differentials of smooth functions, lie groups and their associated lie algebras. We also computed the differential 
            of multiplication and inversion and we looked at the adjoint representations of the lie group and its lie algebra. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 16.pdf">Lecture 16</a> - We saw how to reconstruct a manifold 
            through the atlas. We used this to develop the idea of a tangent bundle. Finally we developed the idea of cocycles and 
            used it to define vector bundles and fibre bundles. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 17.pdf">Lecture 17</a> - We gave the definition of immersions, 
            submersions and local diffeomorphisms. We motivated the regular level set theorem. We say a lot of examples of manifolds that 
            are used in physics.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 18.pdf">Lecture 18</a> - We found the tangent spaces of the
            manifold examples we saw the last. Moreover we gave a way of moving tangent spaces around on lie groups, more specifically we saw
            how to move the lie algebra around to get the tangent spaces at other places. for matrix groups. We saw how tangent vectors
            transformed to give motivation in defining cotangent vectors. We then defined the cotangent bundle and sections of vector bundles
            which gave rise to the definition of vector fields and differential 1-forms.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 19.pdf">Lecture 19</a> - This time it was more discussion based but we 
            talked about the other tensor bundles associated to the tangent bundle. We talked about local expressions of smooth tensor fields. 
            We also saw how these tensor fields can be thought of as \(C^\infty(M)\)-linear maps. We introduced the Riemannian metric and symplectic form 
            which are some of the most important types of tensor fields that we will worry about.
        </li>
        <br>
        <li> <a href="../Geometry of Physics/Lecture Notes/Lecture Meeting 20.pdf">Lecture 20</a> - We talked about vector fields and 
            flows. We defined the Lie bracket and the lie derivative and defined a relation between them.
