  <h1>Comics I Have Read</h1>

  <p>
    I really enjoy reading and mainly I like to read Sci-Fi and Horror. Comic books are a perfect place for such settings. My favorite comic book 
    characters are Batman and Flash. One of the main things I plan to do here is just share the comics I have read and maybe give a breif summary
    of what happens in the comic. I also want to use this as motivation to read newer types of comics but I am not too sure about that, I might
    try it out, I might not.
  </p>

  <p>
    In terms of Flash comics, I think one of the best comic I have read is Flashpoint. I think that the story said beautifully and the world
    building is equally as beautiful. It also serves as an interetsting way to forgo past characters for newer ones in a way that is 
    canonincal to the universe. 
  </p>

  <p>
    For Batman comics, I think one of the best ones is Batman Year One or one of the Batman Shaman comics. The argument for Year One is that 
    it is the quintessential batman comic for his origin. Basically all main characters to the Batman universe are developed and the "main" villian,
    the Joker, is also introduced. For Batman Shaman, I think the world building in that story was rather nice and moreover I just generally 
    liked reading the comic.
