    <h1>Spinors In Curved Spacetime</h1>

    <p>
        I took the course PHY484 (General Relativity II) in my third year of undergraduate study at the University of Toronto and part of that 
        was a final project talking about a topic of our choosing. I chose the topic of spinors in curved spacetime. This document is a 
        collection of information associated to the topic and is a very brief introduction to the subject. It relies heavily on knowing some 
        of the physics before hand such as the Dirac equation, as that is that main motivation, along with spin in quantum mechanics. 
        The math is also quite over the top and I hope to make a series of posts discussing each of the more complex topics. 
    </p>
