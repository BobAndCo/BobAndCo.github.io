    <h1>A Journey Through Relativistic Lagrangians</h1>

    <p>

        Before we even start, I will mentioned that I will use the Einstein Summation Convention the entire duration of the article.
        We start by noting that a lot of classical mechanics is done through the principle of least action. Which says that there is a 
        functional of the positions and the velocities such that the motion undergone is an extremum of the functional. The common notation is 
        to say that the action is \(S\) and we note that  
        \[
            S = \int \mathcal{L}(x^\mu, \dot{x}^\mu, t)\,\mathrm{d}t
        \]

        Now from variational calculus we see that the extremum of \(S\) is obtained when the positions and velocities satisfy the Euler-Lagrange
        equations, that is 
        \[
            \frac{\dd}{\dd t}\pdv{\L}{\dot{x}^\mu} = \pdv{\L}{x^\mu}
        \]

        In nonrelativistic mechanics we find that \(\mathcal{L} = K - U\) (up to the addition of a total time derivative). The Lagrangian for 
        a free particle in nonrelativistic dynamics is just the kinetic energy. So 
        \[
            \L = \frac{1}{2}m\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}_\mu
        \]

        We can introduce different metric tensors and get different Lagrangians because \(\dot{x}_\mu = g_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^\nu\), hence the 
        Lagrangian is 
        \[
            \L = \frac{1}{2}mg_{\mu\nu}\dot{x}^\mu\dot{x}^\nu
        \]
        After playing around with the Euler-Lagrange equations we get that the equations of motion are 
        \[
            \ddot{x}^\mu + \Gamma^{\mu}_{\,\,\nu\rho}\dot{x}^{\nu}\dot{x}^{\rho} = 0
        \]
        Here the \(\Gamma^{\mu}_{\,\,\nu\rho}\) are called the Christoffel symbols and the symbols are given by 
        \[
            \Gamma^{\mu}_{\,\,\nu\rho} = \frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\sigma}\left(\pdv{g_{\sigma\nu}}{x^\rho} + \pdv{g_{\sigma\rho}}{x^{\nu}} - \pdv{g_{\nu\rho}}{x^\sigma}\right)
        \]
