    <h1>Spinors In Curved Spacetime</h1>

    <p>
        I took the course PHY484 (General Relativity II) in my third year of undergraduate study at the University of Toronto and part of that was a final project
        talking about a topic of our choosing. I chose spinors in curved spacetime. This document is more a collection of information and 
        a very brief introduction to the subject. It relies heavily on knowing some of the physics before hand such as the dirac equation.
        As that is that main motivation, along with spin in quantum mechanics, to talk about spinros in the first place. The math is also
        quite over the top and I hope to make a series of posts discussing each of the more complex topics.
