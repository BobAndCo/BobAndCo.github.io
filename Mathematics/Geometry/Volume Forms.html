    <h1>Volume Forms Over Manifolds(and submanfolds)</h1>

    <p>
      Let us lead this post with some motivation. Suppose we were given the two dimensional submanifold in \(\R^2\) by \(\bar{B}(0; R)\) 
      with the closed ball of radius \(R\) centered at the origin. Now we were tasked with finding the area of this manifold. 
      Note that this amounts us to find the integral
      \[

          v(\bar{B}(0; R)) = \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}\mathrm{d}x \wedge dy

      \]
      But this integral is easy to compute since we can use polar change of variables to note that 
      \begin{align}
        v(\bar{B}(0; R)) &= \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}dx \wedge dy \\
        &= \int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{2\pi}r\,d\theta dr \\
        &= \int_{0}^{R}r\,dr\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\theta \\
        &= \pi R^2
      \end{align}
      This is exactly what we expect. So is there a way to assign such a volume to every manifold? And the answer is that it is not that simple.
      With open submanifolds \(M\) of \(\R^n\) we can do the same procedure as above where we take the canonical volume form which we will call
      \(\omega = \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n\) and the inclusion map \(i: M \to \R^n\) and note that 
      \(i^*\omega \in \Omega^n(M)\). But the inclusion is just identity restricted to the submanifold and so the integal we perform is just over the
      region, just as above.
    </p>

    <p>
      We should make clear what is a volume form on a manifold. After this we will answer the question of if every manifold admits one. After that
      we will discuss some canonical choices of volumes forms. Finally we will discuss some of the use cases of volume forms in the context of 
      (psuedo)Riemannian manifolds
    </p>

    <p>
      To make it clear, a volume form on a manifold \(M\) of dimension \(m\) is a top form \(\omega \in \Omega^m(M)\) such that for all \(p \in M\)
      we have that \(\omega_p \not\equiv 0\). In other words, at each \(p \in M\) there are vectors \(v_{p1}, \dots, v_{pm} \in T_pM\) such that 
      \[
        \omega_p(v_{1p}, \dots, v_{mp}) = 1
      \]
      We may choose this to be one by rescaling the tangent vectors appropriately. This requirement seems trivial but as we will see below such 
      differential forms dont always exist. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Since for each \(p \in M\) we have that \(\dim\bigwedge^mT_pM = 1\) we can take any nonzero tensor \(\omega_p\) and see that 
      \(\text{span}\{\omega_p\} = \bigwedge^mT_pM\). Locally, i.e. on a chart (\(U, \varphi\)), we can pullback the volume form on \(\R^m\) back 
      to a volume form on \(U\). We can check this by noting that the canonical volume form on \(\R^m\) is the determinant function on each tangent
      space and in local coordinates we have that 
      \[
        \varphi^*(\mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^m) = \mathrm{d}\varphi^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}\varphi^m
      \]
      but we know that 
      \[
        \mathrm{d}\varphi^i = \frac{\partial\varphi^i}{\partial y^j}\mathrm{d}x^j
      \]
      using summation convention, hence 
      \[
        \mathrm{d}\varphi^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}\varphi^m = (\det D\varphi)\, \mathrm{d}y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}y^m
      \]
      and since the determinant is nonzero, given that \(\varphi\) is a diffeomorphism, we have that this is a volume form on \(U\). This shows
      that if \(M\) can be coveredd by one chart then there must be a volume form. Moreover this gives rise to a natural orientation on \(M\)
      since we may pullback the standand frame on \(\R^m\) to get an orientation. Let us explore this further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose (\(M, \omega\)) is a smooth manifold with \(\omega\) a volume form on \(M\). Is it true that \(M\) must be orientable?
      Let us try to figure this out. Note first that at each point \(p \in M\) we have that \(\omega_p\) defines an orientation. To see 
      this note that if we take two ordered basis \(v_1, \dots, v_m\) and \(w_1, \dots, w_m\) of \(T_pM\) and let the change of basis 
      matrix be \(A\) such that \(Av_i = w_i\) then note that 
      \(\omega_p(w_1, \dots, w_m) = \omega_p(Av_1, \dots, Av_m) = \det(A)\omega_p(v_1, \dots, v_m)\). So now if \(\det(A) > 0\) then these
      bases are in the same orientation and if \(\det(A) < 0\) they are in the opposite. This means that the top form gives rise to a partition
      of the set of ordered bases in two, which we may take to be the orientation. So, at each point \(\omega\) forces a pointwise orientation
      of \(M\). Now to show that \(\omega\) defines an orientation on \(M\) we start by taking an open connected set \(U \subseteq M\) and a
      local frame \(\{X_i\}\) moreover, take the dual coframe \(\{X^i\}\). Now in this setting we have that 
      \(\omega = f\,X^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge X^m\) this now means that \(\omega(X_1, \dots, X_m) = f\). Since \(\omega_p \neq 0\) for any 
      \(p \in U\) we cannot have \(f(p) = 0\), hence on \(U\) f is either always positive or always negative (since \(U\) is connected). 
      Hence we have a pointwise orientation, moreover the fact that locally this is always the same sign gives us the continuity of 
      the pointwise orientation. This is all we needed, since these collections of local frame (up to changing sign for positive orientation) 
      make up the defintion of an orienation on \(M\). 
    </p>

    <p>
      The exposition above shows that orientation and the existance of volume forms are one in the same thing. But can we make this stronger?
      By this I mean, suppose \(M\) is a oriented smooth manifold, does there exist a volume form \(\omega\)? We can deconstruct the argument
      above to define a collection of local forms. Then using a patition of unity note that the form may be defined globally. We must now 
      show that this form is smooth. But this follows quickly as on each local frame we have defined a smooth form and the smooth combination
      of smooth forms is smooth. Hence we have a nowhere vanishing top form. 
    </p>

    <p>
      With all this out of the way, let me introduce my favorite case of existance. Suppose \(f: M \to \R\) is a smooth function
      with \(c \in \R\) a regular value. Then \(S = f^{-1}(c)\) is a regular submanifold of \(M\) of dimension \(\dim M - 1\). 
      We now see that this submanifold is always orientable if \(M\) is. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Since Riemannian metrics always exist, we can choose one, and then define the gradient of the function \(f\). Now we will show that 
      \(\text{grad}(f)\) is nowhere tangent to \(S\). From the defintion of the gradient we have that the gradient is the unique vector 
      field such that 
      \[
        \langle\text{grad}(f), X\rangle = \mathrm{d}f(X) = Xf
      \]
      So now to show that \(\text{grad}(f)\) is nowhere tangent to \(S\), let \(\{X_i\}\) be a local orthonormal frame on \(S\) and 
      since we are looking at \(S\) as a submanifold we idenity the tangent spaces appropriately. Let \(\{Y_i\}\) be a local orthonormal frame 
      on \(M\) such that on \(S\) the first \(m-1\, Y_i\) are the \(X_i\) then in this case we have that 
      \[
        \text{grad}(f) = a^iY_i
      \]
      using the inner product characterization, on \(S\) we have that 
      \[
        a^i =  \langle\text{grad}(f), X_i\rangle = \mathrm{d}f(X_i) = 0 
      \]
      for \(i = 1, \dots, m-1\). Hence \(\text{grad}(f) \notin T_pS\) for all \(p \in S\). Now this vector field exists, moreover the existance
      of such a nowhere vanishing vector field is dependent only on the choice of Riemannian metric and Riemannian metrics always exist on
      any smooth manifolds. Hence we may take that such a vector field always exists. Let \(X\) be a vector field on \(M\) that is nowhere
      tangent to \(S\) then on \(S\) we have that \(\iota_X\omega\) is nowhere vanishing since at every point we can always take a basis of 
      \(T_pS\) such that the collection including \(X\) gives a basis for \(T_pM\). So the form \(i^*\iota_X\omega \in \Omega^{m-1}(S)\) is a 
      nowhere vanishing top form and hence is a volume form. From our above exposition this implies that \(S\) must be orientable.
    </p>

    <p>
      From this we see that the existance of a nowhere vanishing vector filed is enough to find an orientation on any \(m-1\) dimensional
      submanifold of \(M\). For \(0 < n \leq m\) it is sufficient to find \(m-n\) nowhere tangent and everywhere linearly independent to 
      submanifold to find an orientation. These vector fields may merely be local frames as well. 
    </p>

    <h2>Canonical Volume forms</h2>
    <p>
      There are two main structures that are used in the study of differential geometry, those are: Riemannian metrics, symplectic forms and Lie groups. 
      Arguably the easiest one to discuss is the Lie group. 
    </p>
      
    <h3>Lie Groups</h3>

    <p>
      So let \(G\) be a Lie group of dimension \(n\). Now let \(\omega_e \in \bigwedge^nT_eM\) be nonzero. Moreover 
      note that \(\ell_g: G \to G\) defined by \(h \to gh\) is a diffeomorphism. Now at each point \(g \in G\) define \(\omega_g = \ell_{g^{-1}}^*\omega_e\). To see that this
      is a volume form, take a basis \(T_eG\), lets call it \(v_{1e}, \dots, v_{ne}\). Then \(\omega_e(v_{1e}, \dots, v_{ne}) \neq 0\), we choose a basis since this the \(\omega_e\)
      evaluates to something nonzero if and only if the collection is a basis. So now note that \(\mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}}:T_gG \to T_eG\) is an isomorphism, so there are 
      unique tangent vectors \(v_{1g}, \dots, v_{ng} \in T_gG\) such that \((\mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}})_g(v_{ig}) = v_{ie}\). Note now that 
      \begin{align}
        \omega_g(v_{1g}, \dots, v_{ng}) &= (\ell_{g^{-1}}^*\omega_e)_g(v_{1g}, \dots, v_{ng}) \\
                                        &= \omega_e(\mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}}(v_{1g}), \dots, \mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}}(v_{ng})) \\
                                        &= \omega_e(v_{1e}, \dots, v_{ne}) \\
                                        &\neq 0
      \end{align}
      This shows that the \(\omega_g\) is nonzero. So \(\omega\) is a rough nonzero top form on \(G\). Now we must show that this form is actually smooth. To do this, let us
      make use of a global frame on \(G\). Let us choose a left invariant global frame \(\{X_i\}\), then we note that if \(\omega_e(X_1|_e, \dots, X_n|_e) = c \in \R\) then
      \begin{align}
        \omega_g(X_1|_g, \dots, X_n|_g) &= (\ell_{g^{-1}}^*\omega_e)_g(X_1|_g, \dots, X_n|_g) \\
                                        &= \omega_e(\mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}}(X_1|_g), \dots, \mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}}(X_n|_g)) \\
                                        &= \omega_e(X_1|_e, \dots, X_n|_e) \\
                                        &= c
      \end{align}
      where we need the left invariance to compute \(\mathrm{d}\ell_{g^{-1}}(X_i|_g)\). Since we have a global frame, every vector field \(X \in \mathfrak{X}(M)\) may be written
      as \(X = x^iX_i\) for some smooth functions \(x^i\). Finally let us take any collection of vector field \(\{Y_i\}_{i = 1}^{n}\) and let us consider the function 
      \[
        p \mapsto \omega_p(Y_1|_p, \dots, Y_n|_p)
      \]
      the form is smooth if and only if this function is smooth. But note that 
      \begin{align}
        \omega_p(Y_1|_p, \dots, Y_n|_p) &= \omega_p(y_1^i(p)X_i|_p, \dots, y_n^i(p)X_i|_p) \\
                                        &= y_1^{i_1}(p)\cdots y_n^{i_n}(p)\omega_p(X_{i_1}|_p, \dots, X_{i_n}|_p)
      \end{align}
      but this is a product and sum of smooth functions, hence this form is smooth. From this we have seen a very important result, that every Lie group is orientable. 
    </p>
      
    <h3>Symplectic Manifolds</h3>

    <p>
      So let \((M ,\omega)\) be a symplectic manifold of dimension \(2m\). Now 
      this means that at each point \(p \in M\) we have \(\omega_p\) is nondegenerate. If we take a symplectic basis 
      \(v_{1p}, \dots, v_{mp}, w_{1p}, \dots, w_{mp}\) of \(T_pM\) then 
      \[
        \omega_p = v_{1p} \wedge w_{1p} + \cdots + v_{mp} \wedge w_{mp}
      \]
      So if we take the \(m\) fold wedge product \(\omega^m = \omega_p \wedge \cdots \wedge \omega_p\) we get 
      \[
        \omega_p = \pm m!v_{1p} \wedge w_{1p} \wedge \cdots v_{mp} \wedge w_{mp}
      \]
      where the sign is dependent on whether \(m\) is even or odd. Now
      \[
        \omega_p(v_{1p}, w_{1p}, \dots, v_{mp}, w_{mp}) \neq 0 
      \]
      hence this is a nondegenerate form. Since this holds for all the points in the manifold we note that \(\omega^m\) is a volume form for \(M\). So we have a canonical choice
      of colume form called the Liouville volume form given by \(\frac{\omega^m}{m!}\). Here we have the \(m!\) for normalization reasons. This is very important because This
      gives us that Symplectic manifolds must be orientable. In particular, it gives a sort of nontrivial proof of the fact that for any manifold \(X\) the cotangent bundle
      \(T^*X\) must be orientable, since it has a canonical symplectic form defined on it. 
    </p>

    <!--

    I have no idea what this is trying to get at, maybe I will understand in the future?

    <p>    
      But we can do this integral in another way. We note that over \(\R^2\) the area form \(\omega = dx \wedge dy\) is closed
      since it is a 2-form over \(\R^2\) hence by Poincare's Lemma there is a form \(\eta \in \Omega^1(\R^2)\) such that \(d\eta = \omega\). Let us find this
      form. We can start by seeing that \(\eta = \eta_x\,dx + \eta_y\,dy\) this now gives us that \(d\eta = \left(\frac{\partial \eta_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \eta_x}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\wedge dy\). 
      But we can guess something like \(\eta = -\frac{y}{2}\,dx + x\frac{x}{2}\,dy\) this gives us exactly what we want. So note that \(S^1(R) = \partial \bar{B}(0; R)\) so
      by Stokes' Theorem we have that 
      \[
          \int_{S^1(R)}\eta = \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}\omega
      \]
