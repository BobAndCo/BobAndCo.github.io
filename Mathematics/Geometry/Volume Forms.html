    <h1>Volume Forms Over Manifolds(and submanfolds)</h1>

    <p>
      Let us lead this post with some motivation. Suppose we were given the two dimensional submanifold in \(\R^2\) by \(\bar{B}(0; R)\) 
      with the closed ball of radius \(R\) centered at the origin. Now we were tasked with finding the area of this manifold. 
      Note that this amounts us to find the integral
      \[

          v(\bar{B}(0; R)) = \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}\mathrm{d}x \wedge dy

      \]
      But this integral is easy to compute since we can use polar change of variables to note that 
      \begin{align}
        v(\bar{B}(0; R)) &= \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}dx \wedge dy \\
        &= \int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{2\pi}r\,d\theta dr \\
        &= \int_{0}^{R}r\,dr\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\theta \\
        &= \pi R^2
      \end{align}
      This is exactly what we expect. So is there a way to assign such a volume to every manifold? And the answer is that it is not that simple.
      With open submanifolds \(M\) of \(\R^n\) we can do the same procedure as above where we take the canonical volume form which we will call
      \(\omega = \mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^n\) and the inclusion map \(i: M \to \R^n\) and note that 
      \(i^*\omega \in \Omega^n(M)\). But the inclusion is just identity restricted to the submanifold and so the integal we perform is just over the
      region, just as above.

      We should make clear what is a volume form on a manifold. After this we will answer the question of if every manifold admits one. After that
      we will discuss some canonical choices of volumes forms. Finally we will discuss some of the use cases of volume forms in the context of 
      (psuedo)Riemannian manifolds
    </p>

    <p>
      To make it clear, a volume form on a manifold \(M\) of dimension \(m\) is a top form \(\omega \in \Omega^m(M)\) such that for all \(p \in M\)
      we have that \(\omega_p \not\equiv 0\). In other words, at each \(p \in M\) there are vectors \(v_{p1}, \dots, v_{pm} \in T_pM\) such that 
      \[
        \omega_p(v_{1p}, \dots, v_{mp}) = 1
      \]
      We may choose this to be one by rescaling the tangent vectors appropriately. This requirement seems trivial but as we will see below such 
      differential forms dont always exist. 
    </p>

    <p>
      Since for each \(p \in M\) we have that \(\dim\bigwedge^mT_pM = 1\) we can take any nonzero tensor \(\omega_p\) and see that 
      \(\text{span}\{\omega_p\} = \bigwedge^mT_pM\). Locally, i.e. on a chart (\(U, \varphi\)), we can pullback the volume form on \(\R^m\) back 
      to a volume form on \(U\). We can check this by noting that the canonical volume form on \(\R^m\) is the determinant function on each tangent
      space and in local coordinates we have that 
      \[
        \varphi^*(\mathrm{d}x^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}x^m) = \mathrm{d}\varphi^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}\varphi^m
      \]
      but we know that 
      \[
        \mathrm{d}\varphi^i = \frac{\partial\varphi^i}{\partial y^j}\mathrm{d}x^j
      \]
      using summation convention, hence 
      \[
        \mathrm{d}\varphi^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}\varphi^m = \det D\varphi\, \mathrm{d}y^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \mathrm{d}y^m
      \]
      and since the determinant is nonzero, given that \(\varphi\) is a diffeomorphism, we have that this is a volume form on \(U\). This shows
      that if \(M\) can be coveredd by one chart then there must be a volume form. Moreover this gives rise to a natural orientation on \(M\)
      since we may pullback the standand frame on \(\R^m\) to get an orientation. Let us explore this further.
    </p>

    <p>
      Suppose (\(M, \omega\)) is a smooth manifold with \(\omega\) a volume form on \(M\). Is it true that \(M\) must be orientable?
    </p>

    <p>    
      But we can do this integral in another way. We note that over \(\R^2\) the area form \(\omega = dx \wedge dy\) is closed
      since it is a 2-form over \(\R^2\) hence by Poincare's Lemma there is a form \(\eta \in \Omega^1(\R^2)\) such that \(d\eta = \omega\). Let us find this
      form. We can start by seeing that \(\eta = \eta_x\,dx + \eta_y\,dy\) this now gives us that \(d\eta = \left(\frac{\partial \eta_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \eta_x}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\wedge dy\). 
      But we can guess something like \(\eta = -\frac{y}{2}\,dx + x\frac{x}{2}\,dy\) this gives us exactly what we want. So note that \(S^1(R) = \partial \bar{B}(0; R)\) so
      by Stokes' Theorem we have that 
      \[
          \int_{S^1(R)}\eta = \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}\omega
      \]
