    <h1>Volume Forms Over Manifolds</h1>

    <p>

      Let us lead this post with some motivation. Suppose we were given the two submanifold in \(\R^2\) by \(\bar{B}(0; R)\) with the closed ball of radius 
      \(R\) centered at the origin. Now we were tasked with finding the area of this manifold. Note that this amounts us to find the integral
      \[

          v(\bar{B}(0; R)) = \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}dx \wedge dy

      \]
      But this integral is easy to compute since we can use polar change of variables to note that 
      \begin{align}
        v(\bar{B}(0; R)) &= \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}dx \wedge dy \\
        &= \int_{0}^{R}\int_{0}^{2\pi}r\,d\theta dr \\
        &= \int_{0}^{R}r\,dr\int_{0}^{2\pi}d\theta \\
        &= \pi R^2
      \end{align}
      This is exactly what we expect. But we can do this integral in another way. We note that over \(\R^2\) the area form \(\omega = dx \wedge dy\) is closed
      since it is a 2-form over \(\R^2\) hence by Poincare's Lemma there is a form \(\eta \in \Omega^1(\R^2)\) such that \(d\eta = \omega\). Let us find this
      form. We can start by seeing that \(\eta = \eta_x\,dx + \eta_y\,dy\) this now gives us that \(d\eta = \left(\frac{\partial \eta_y}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial \eta_x}{\partial y}\right)\,dx\wedge dy\). 
      But we can guess something like \(\eta = -\frac{y}{2}\,dx + x\frac{x}{2}\,dy\) this gives us exactly what we want. So note that \(S^1(R) = \partial \bar{B}(0; R)\) so
      by Stokes' Theorem we have that 
      \[
          \int_{S^1(R)}\eta = \int_{\bar{B}(0; R)}\omega
      \]
