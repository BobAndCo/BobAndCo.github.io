      Let us have some fun with the vector space \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\) where \(V\) is an \(n\)-dimensional real vector space. 
      This space denotes the set of alternating \(k\) forms on \(V\). We note that if we denote by
      \[
          \phi_I = \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}
      \] 
      where \(I = (i_1, \dots, i_k)\) and \(\phi_i\) is a basis for \(V^*\)
      then the the following collection of vectors
      \(\{\phi_I \mid I = (i_1, \dots, i_k) \text{ and } 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \leq n\}\)
      is a basis for \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\). This basis now shows us that \(\dim \Lambda^k(V^*) = {n \choose k}\). 
      Since \({n \choose n-k} = {n \choose k}\) we get that \(\Lambda^{k}(V^*)\) and \(\Lambda^{n-k}(V^*)\) are
      isomorphic vector space. But is there a useful isomorphism between these spaces? If we add additional structure
      like in the case of <a href="../Linear Algebra/rieszRepresentation.html">Riesz Representation</a> is there a 
      canonical isomorphism? This is what we explore now.

    <b>Lemma</b>
    <p>
        For every \(I_k\), where \(I_k\) is an ordered subset of \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) that is stictly increasing, 
        there is a unique form \(\eta \in \Lambda^{n-k}(V^*)\) such that 
        \[
            \phi_I \wedge \omega = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
        \]
    </div>

    <div id="proof">
        Proof: We first begin by calling \(\omega = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n\). Let us see 
        what happens when we have a singleton, so we want to find a form \(\star\phi_i\) 
        such that \(\phi_i \wedge \star\phi_i = \omega\). Now let \(v_j\) be vectors in \(V\) such that 
        \(\phi_k(v_j) = \delta_{jk}\). Now we show that \(\star\phi_i = \iota_{v_i}\omega\). So note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                \phi_i \wedge \star\phi_i 
                &= \phi_i \wedge \iota_{v_i}\omega \\
                &= \phi_i \wedge \sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{j-1}\phi_j(v_i)\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_j} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \phi_i \wedge (-1)^{i-1}\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_j} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \omega
            \end{align*}
        \]
        This concludes the case when we have a singleton. With this intuition out of the way suppose we have 
        \[
            \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}
        \]
        then consider \(\star(\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}) = \iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_1}}\omega\),
        to save space we will call \(\eta = \star(\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k})\) so we compute
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \eta
                &= \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_1}}\omega \\
                &= \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_2}}(\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n) \\
                &= \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge (-1)^{i_1 - 1}(-1)^{i_2 - 2}\iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_3}}(\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_2}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n) \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - k}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - 1}\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}(-1)^{i_2 - 2}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_2} \wedge \phi_{i_1} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= (-1)^{i_2 - 2}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_2} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_2}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \omega
            \end{align*}
        \]
        Note that we just redistributed the powers to be able to swap them around, since the exponent powers add under multiplication.
        This shows that such a vector does in fact exist.

        Now note that this construction does depend on the choice of basis. To make this this a basis independent contruction we 
        will add in a symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form (we will call this an inner product) on our space. But before we do that, let us first note that the 
        \(\phi_I \mapsto \star\phi_I\) extends linearly to a map \(\star: \Lambda^k(V^\ast) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V^\ast)\).
    </p>

    <div id="container">
    <b>Theorem</b>
    <p>
        The map \(\star: \Lambda^k(V^\ast) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V^\ast)\) defined by 
        \[
            \phi_I \mapsto \iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_1}}\omega 
        \]
        is an isomorphism of vector spaces.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="proof">
        Proof: We know that \(\dim\Lambda^k(V^\ast) = \dim\Lambda^{n-k}(V^\ast)\) so it suffices to show that this map is injective.
        So suppose that \(\varphi \in \Lambda^k(V^\ast)\) such that \(\star\varphi = 0\). Suppose also that 
        \(\varphi = \varphi^{i_1\cdots i_k}\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}\) and hence we have 
        \[
            0 = \star\varphi = (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots (-1)^{i_k - k}\varphi^{i_1\cdots i_k}\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
        \]
        this means all the coefficients are \(0\). This means that \(\varphi = 0\). Hence \(\star\) is injective and moreover
        it is an isomorphism
    </div>

    <p>
        Now let us look at some examples on how to compute such an object and then let us introduce an inner product to make
        this constrcution canonical.
    </p>

    <div id="container">
      <b>Example I</b>
          <p>
          Let us take the space \(\Lambda^1(\R^3)\), now the elementary \(1\)-tensors are \(e_1^*, e_2^*, e_3^*\) 
          so using the map above we get 
          \[
              \star e_1^* = (-1)^{1-1}e_2^* \wedge e_3^* = e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          but it is obvious that 
          \[
              e_1^* \wedge (\star e_1^*) = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          Similarly we have that 
          \[
              \star e_2^* = (-1)^{2-1}e_1^* \wedge e_3^* = -e_1^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          but we can check that 
          \[
              e_2^* \wedge (\star e_2^*) = -e_2^* \wedge e_1^* \wedge e_3^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          and finally we have that 
          \[
              \star e_3^* = (-1)^{3-1}e_1^* \wedge e_2^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^*
          \]
          but it is obvious that 
          \[
              e_3^* \wedge (\star e_3^*) = e_3^* \wedge e_1^* \wedge e_2^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]

      </div>

      <p>

          But we dont have to restrict ourselves to trivial examples. Once we have these we can find the hodge star of other 
          \(1\)-forms. So let us look at the following example

        <b>Example II</b>

                Suppose we have \(\omega \in \Lambda^1(\R^3)\) given by \(\omega = 3 e_1^*\) then we get that 
                \[
                    \star\omega = 3e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
                \]
                from the computation done above. Moreover we note that 
                \[

    <h3>Extension of Inner Products to Tensor Spaces</h3>
    
      <p>
          The last example shows the need for an inner product. So suppose we now endow our vector space with an inner product
          \(g\). Now we want to find a way to extend this inner product to all tensor spaces associated to \(V\). We first 
          extend this to the dual space. First note that \(g\) we may treat this as a map 
          \(\hat{g}: V \to V\) given by \(\hat{g}(v) = \iota_vg\) and by the nondegeneracy we have that this is an isomorphism,
          as a slight nod to the <a href="../Linear Algebra/rieszRepresentation.html">Riesz Representation theorem</a>. 
      </p>

      <div id="container">
        <b>Theorem: Inner Product on Dual Space</b>
            <p>
                We may define an inner product on \(V^\ast\) as 
                \[
                    h(\varphi, \psi) = g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\psi))
                \]
            </p>
      </div>

       <div id="proof">
            Proof: We need to first show that this is bilinear, note that we will first show that it is linear in the first entry,
            then we will show it is symmetric which will then show that it is bilinear. So let \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\)
            and let \(\varphi, \psi, \eta \in V^\ast\) then we compute
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    h(\alpha\varphi + \beta\psi, \eta)
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\alpha\varphi + \beta\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= g(\alpha\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi) + \beta\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= g(\alpha\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) + g(\beta\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= \alpha g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) + \beta g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= \alpha h(\varphi, \eta) + \beta h(\psi, \eta)
                \end{align*}
            \]
            Next we show that this is symmetric, note that 
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    h(\varphi, \psi) 
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\psi)) \\
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi)) \\
                    &= h(\psi, \varphi)
                \end{align*}
            \]
            hence we conclude that \(h\) is bilinear since 
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    h(\varphi, \alpha\psi + \beta\eta)
                    &= h(\alpha\psi + \beta\eta, \varphi) \\
                    &= \alpha h(\psi, \varphi) + \beta h(\eta, \varphi) \\
                    &= \alpha h(\varphi, \psi) + \beta h(\varphi, \eta) 
                \end{align*}
            \]
            Just as needed. Now we need to show that it is nondegenerate. Suppose \(\psi \in V^\ast\) is such that 
            \(h(\psi, \varphi) = 0\) for all \(\varphi \in V^\ast\). Then note that 
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    0 
                    &= h(\psi, \psi) \\
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\psi))
                \end{align*}
            \]
            and but non degeneracy of \(g\) we have \(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi) = 0\) which means that \(\psi = 0\) since 
            \(\hat{g}\) is an isomorphism. Hence \(h\) is an inner product on \(V^\ast\) just as we needed.
       </div>

       <p>
            Using this we can now extend the inner product on a vector space \(V\) to all its tensor products 
            \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V) = (V^\ast)^{\otimes k} \otimes V^{\otimes l}\). We will first extend them to decomposable tensors and then we
            extend it bilinearly to the entire tensor space.

       <div id="container">
        <b>Theorem: Inner Product on Tensor Spaces \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\)</b>
            <p>
                We may define an inner product on \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\) on decomposable tensors as 
                \[
                    \langle \varphi^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^k \otimes v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_l, 
                    \psi^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \psi^k \otimes w_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes w_l \rangle 
                    = h(\varphi^1, \psi^1)\cdots h(\varphi^k, \psi^k)g(v_1, w_1) \cdots g(v_l, w_l)
                \]
                and we then extend it to the rest of \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\) by bilinearity.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div id="proof">
        The bilinearity and the symmetry are trivial since it is built into the definition of the function. Now we will show that this is 
        nondegenerate. Note that any tensor is a sum of decomposable ones. Let \(e_1, \cdots, e_n\) be an orthonormal basis for \(V\) and let
        \(\varphi^1, \cdots, \varphi^n\) be the corresponding dual basis, meaning that \(\varphi^i(v) = g(v, e_i)\), with the isomorphism given by the inner product on \(V\). 
        Note that by the defintion of the inner product this is an orthonormal basis on \(V^\ast\). Now any \(f \in \mathcal{T}^k_l\) we have 
        \[
            f = f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}\varphi^{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{i_k} \otimes e_{j_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_l}
        \]
        then note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                0 &= \langle f, f\rangle \\
                  &= \langle f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}\varphi^{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{i_k} \otimes e_{j_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_l}, f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l} \varphi^{m_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{m_k} \otimes e_{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{n_l} \rangle \\
                  &= f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l}\langle \varphi^{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{i_k} \otimes e_{j_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_l}, \varphi^{m_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{m_k} \otimes e_{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{n_l} \rangle \\
                  &= f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l}h(\varphi^{i_1}, \varphi^{m_1})\cdots h(\varphi^{i_k}, \varphi^{m_k})g(e_{j_1}, e_{n_1})\cdots g(e_{j_l}, e_{n_l}) \\
                  &= f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l}\delta^{i_1m_1}\cdots \delta^{i_km_k}\delta_{j_1n_1}\cdots\delta_{j_ln_l} \\
                  &= (f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l})^2
            \end{align*}
        \]
        hence \(f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l} = 0\) for all possible indices. This means that \(f = 0\). This makes the function as defined
        is an inner product on \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\)
      </div>

      <p>
        With this, we note that the space of forms is a subspace of \(\mathcal{T}^k(V)\) and hence the inner product restricts to an inner product
        on the space of forms.
