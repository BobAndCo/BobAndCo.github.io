    <h1>Hodge Star Operator</h1>

    <p>
        This is still a work in progress - April 8, 2025

    </p>

    <p>

      Let us have some fun with the vector space \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\) where \(V\) is an \(n\)-dimensional real vector space. 
      This space denotes the set of alternating \(k\) forms on \(V\). We note that if we denote by
      \[
          \phi_I = \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}
      \] 
      where \(I = (i_1, \dots, i_k)\) and \(\phi_i\) are a basis for \(V^*\)
      then the the following collection of vectors
      \(\{\phi_I \mid I = (i_1, \dots, i_k) \text{ and } 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \leq n\}\)
      is a basis for \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\). This basis now shows us that \(\dim \Lambda^k(V^*) = {n \choose k}\). 
      Since \({n \choose n-k} = {n \choose k}\) we get that \(\Lambda^{k}(V^*)\) and \(\Lambda^{n-k}(V^*)\) are
      isomorphic vector space. But is there a useful isomorphism between these spaces? If we add additional structure
      like in the case of <a href="../Linear Algebra/rieszRepresentation.html">Riesz Representation</a> is there a 
      canonical isomorphism? This is what we explore now. So let us show that for every \(I_k\), where is an ordered 
      subset of \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) that is stictly increasing, there is a unique form \(\omega \in \Lambda^{n-k}(V^*)\) 
      such that 
      \[
        \phi_I \wedge \omega = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
      \]
      Let us denote by \(\star\phi_I = \omega\), if such a form does exist, then the equation above is the same as 
      \[
          \phi_I \wedge (\star\phi_I) = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
      \]
      Let us first start with the case where \(I\) is a singleton then note that we want to find \(\star\phi_i \in \Lambda^{n-1}(V)\) 
      such that
      \[
          \phi_i \wedge (\star\phi_i) = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_i = (-1)^{i-1}\phi_i \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
      \]
      this gives us that 
      \[
          \star\phi_i = (-1)^{i-1} \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
      \]
      Let us now show that this the unique form that accomplishes this. An arbitrary \(\omega \in \Lambda^{n-1}(V)\) can be written as 
      \[
          \omega = \sum_{j=1}^{n}\omega_j\,\phi_1\wedge\cdots\wedge\widehat{\phi}_j\wedge\cdots\wedge\phi_n
      \]
      We also required that \(\phi_i \wedge \omega = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n\). Now note that for 
      \(k \neq i\) we have that xxxxxxxxxx
      
      But note that this just fixes the \(i^\text{th}\)
      component of \(\omega\). So this is not unique. We will deal with this issue later. Now note that \(\star\phi_i\) and \(\star\phi_j\) 
      are basis vectors for \(\Lambda^{1}(V)\) moreover note that if \(i \neq j\) then these are different basis vectors. 
      Now taking \(\omega \in \Lambda^1(V)\) we can write \(\omega = \sum_{i}\omega_i\phi_i\) hence we can define the map 
      \(\star:\Lambda^1(V) \to \Lambda^{n-1}(V)\) by 
      \[
          \star\omega = \sum_{i}(-1)^{i-1}\omega_i\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
      \]
      Since \(\star\) is a map between finite dimensional vector spaces and each basis vector is mapped onto linearly 
      independent vectors that span the codomain space, this map is an isomorphism.

      <b>Example I</b>
          <p>
          Let us take the space \(\Lambda^1(\R^3)\), now the elementary \(1\)-tensors are \(e_1^*, e_2^*, e_3^*\) 
          so using the map above we get 
          \[
              \star e_1^* = (-1)^{1-1}e_2^* \wedge e_3^* = e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          but it is obvious that 
          \[
              e_1^* \wedge (\star e_1^*) = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          Similarly we have that 
          \[
              \star e_2^* = (-1)^{2-1}e_1^* \wedge e_3^* = -e_1^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          but we can check that 
          \[
              e_2^* \wedge (\star e_2^*) = -e_2^* \wedge e_1^* \wedge e_3^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          and finally we have that 
          \[
              \star e_3^* = (-1)^{3-1}e_1^* \wedge e_2^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^*
          \]
          but it is obvious that 
          \[
              e_3^* \wedge (\star e_3^*) = e_3^* \wedge e_1^* \wedge e_2^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]

          But we dont have to restrict ourselves to trivial examples. Once we have these we can find the hodge star of other 
          \(1\)-forms. So let us look at the following example
          
      </p>
          
      <div id="container">
        <b>Example II</b>
            <p>
                Suppose we have \(\omega \in \Lambda^1(\R^3)\) given by \(\omega = 3 e_1^*\) then we get that 
                \[
                    \star\omega = 3e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
                \]
                from the computation done above. Moreover we note that 
                \[
                    \omega \wedge \star\omega = 9e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
                \]
                which happens to be \(\langle \omega, \omega\rangle\) if we identify 
                \[
                    ae_1^* + be_2^* + ce_3^* \mapsto 
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        a \\
                        b \\
                        c
                    \end{pmatrix}
                \]
            </p>
        </div>

      </p>
          
          Building off of the last example let us look at the following example

      </p>

      <div id="container">
        <b>Example III</b>
            <p>
                If we are given \(\omega, \eta \in \Lambda^1(V)\) then note that \(\omega = \sum_{i}\omega_i \phi_i\) and 
                \(\eta = \sum_i \eta_i \phi_i\) then note that 
                \[
                    \star\eta = \sum_{i}(-1)^{i-1}\eta_i\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
                \]
                So note that 
                \[
                  \begin{aligned}
                      \omega \wedge (\star\eta) &= \sum_{i}(-1)^{i-1}\omega_i\eta_i\,\phi_i \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n\\
                                                &= \sum_{i}\omega_i\eta_i\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                                                &= \langle \omega, \eta \rangle \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n 
                  \end{aligned}
                \]
                Given the same identification as in the example above. 
            </p>
        </div>

      <p>
          
          But let us now investigate what happens when we compose the star operator with itself. Note that 
          
          \[
            \begin{CD}
              \Omega^1(M) @>\star>> \Omega^{n-1}(M) @>\star>> \Omega^1(M)\\
            \end{CD}
          \]
