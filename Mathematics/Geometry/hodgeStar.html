      Let us have some fun with the vector space \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\) where \(V\) is an \(n\)-dimensional real vector space. 
      This space denotes the set of alternating \(k\) forms on \(V\). We note that if we denote by
      \[
          \phi_I = \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}
      \] 
      where \(I = (i_1, \dots, i_k)\) and \(\phi_i\) is a basis for \(V^*\)
      then the the following collection of vectors
      \[
        \{\phi_I \mid I = (i_1, \dots, i_k) \text{ and } 1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \leq n\}
      \]
      is a basis for \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\). This basis now shows us that \(\dim \Lambda^k(V^*) = {n \choose k}\). 
      Since \({n \choose n-k} = {n \choose k}\) we get that \(\Lambda^{k}(V^*)\) and \(\Lambda^{n-k}(V^*)\) are
      isomorphic vector space. But is there a useful isomorphism between these spaces? If we add additional structure
      like in the case of <a href="../Linear Algebra/rieszRepresentation.html">Riesz Representation</a> is there a 
      canonical isomorphism? This is what we explore now.

    <b>Lemma</b>
    <p>
        For every \(I_k\), where \(I_k\) is an ordered subset of \(\{1, \dots, n\}\) that is stictly increasing, 
        there is a unique form \(\eta \in \Lambda^{n-k}(V^*)\) such that 
        \[
            \phi_I \wedge \eta = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
        \]
    </div>

    <div id="proof">
        Proof: We first begin by calling \(\omega = \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n\). Let us see 
        what happens when we have a singleton, so we want to find a form \(\star\phi_i\) 
        such that \(\phi_i \wedge \star\phi_i = \omega\). Now let \(v_j\) be vectors in \(V\) such that 
        \(\phi_k(v_j) = \delta_{jk}\). Now we show that \(\star\phi_i = \iota_{v_i}\omega\). So note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                \phi_i \wedge \star\phi_i 
                &= \phi_i \wedge \iota_{v_i}\omega \\
                &= \phi_i \wedge \sum_{j=1}^{n}(-1)^{j-1}\phi_j(v_i)\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_j} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \phi_i \wedge (-1)^{i-1}\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_j} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \omega
            \end{align*}
        \]
        This concludes the case when we have a singleton. With this intuition out of the way suppose we have 
        \[
            \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}
        \]
        then consider \(\star(\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}) = \iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_1}}\omega\),
        to save space we will call \(\eta = \star(\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k})\) so we compute
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \eta
                &= \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_1}}\omega \\
                &= \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_2}}(\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n) \\
                &= \phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge (-1)^{i_1 - 1}(-1)^{i_2 - 2}\iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_3}}(\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_2}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n) \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - k}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - 1}\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}(-1)^{i_2 - 2}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_2} \wedge \phi_{i_1} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= (-1)^{i_2 - 2}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_{i_k} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_2} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_2}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                &= \omega
            \end{align*}
        \]
        Note that we just redistributed the powers to be able to swap them around, since the exponent powers add under multiplication.
        This shows that such a vector does in fact exist.

        Now note that this construction does depend on the choice of basis. To make this this a basis independent contruction we 
        will add in a symmetric nondegenerate bilinear form (we will call this an inner product) on our space. But before we do that, let us first note that the 
        \(\phi_I \mapsto \star\phi_I\) extends linearly to a map \(\star: \Lambda^k(V^\ast) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V^\ast)\).
    </p>

    <div id="container">
    <b>Theorem</b>
    <p>
        The map \(\star: \Lambda^k(V^\ast) \to \Lambda^{n-k}(V^\ast)\) defined by 
        \[
            \phi_I \mapsto \iota_{v_{i_k}}\cdots\iota_{v_{i_1}}\omega 
        \]
        is an isomorphism of vector spaces.
    </p>
    </div>

    <div id="proof">
        Proof: We know that \(\dim\Lambda^k(V^\ast) = \dim\Lambda^{n-k}(V^\ast)\) so it suffices to show that this map is injective.
        So suppose that \(\varphi \in \Lambda^k(V^\ast)\) such that \(\star\varphi = 0\). Suppose also that 
        \(\varphi = \varphi^{i_1\cdots i_k}\phi_{i_1} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{i_k}\) and hence we have 
        \[
            0 = \star\varphi = (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots (-1)^{i_k - k}\varphi^{i_1\cdots i_k}\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
        \]
        this means all the coefficients are \(0\). This means that \(\varphi = 0\). Hence \(\star\) is injective and moreover
        it is an isomorphism.
    </div>
    <div id="proof">
        We can also find the explicit inverse of this map. Note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                \star(\star \phi)_I 
                &= \star((-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots (-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n) \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots (-1)^{i_k - k}\star(\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n) \\
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots (-1)^{i_k - k}(-1)^{j_1 - 1}\cdots (-1)^{j_{n-1} - (n-k)}\phi_I
            \end{align*}
        \]
        where the \(i\) and \(j\) sequences come together to give \(1, \dots, n\). This comes from the definition
        of the Hodge star. Note that the exponent is given by 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                (1 + \dots + n) - (1 + \dots + k) - (1 + \dots + (n - k))
                &= \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - \frac{k(k+1)}{2} - \frac{(n-k)(n-k+1)}{2} \\
                &= \frac{n^2 + n - k^2 - k - n^2 + nk - n + nk - k^2 + k}{2} \\
                &= \frac{-2k^2 + 2nk}{2} \\
                &= k(n-k)
            \end{align*}
        \]
        hence we have 
        \[
            \star(\star \omega) = (-1)^{k(n-k)}\omega
        \]

    <p>
        Now let us look at some examples on how to compute such an object and then let us introduce an inner product to make
        this constrcution canonical.
    </p>

    <div id="container">
      <b>Example I</b>
          <p>
          Let us take the space \(\Lambda^1(\R^3)\), now the elementary \(1\)-tensors are \(e_1^*, e_2^*, e_3^*\) 
          so using the map above we get 
          \[
              \star e_1^* = (-1)^{1-1}e_2^* \wedge e_3^* = e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          but it is obvious that 
          \[
              e_1^* \wedge (\star e_1^*) = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          Similarly we have that 
          \[
              \star e_2^* = (-1)^{2-1}e_1^* \wedge e_3^* = -e_1^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          but we can check that 
          \[
              e_2^* \wedge (\star e_2^*) = -e_2^* \wedge e_1^* \wedge e_3^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          and finally we have that 
          \[
              \star e_3^* = (-1)^{3-1}e_1^* \wedge e_2^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^*
          \]
          but it is obvious that 
          \[
              e_3^* \wedge (\star e_3^*) = e_3^* \wedge e_1^* \wedge e_2^* = e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
          \]
          </p>
      </div>

      <p>

          But we dont have to restrict ourselves to trivial examples. Once we have these we can find the hodge star of other 
          \(1\)-forms. So let us look at the following example
          
      </p>
          
      <div id="container">
        <b>Example II</b>
            <p>
                Suppose we have \(\omega \in \Lambda^1(\R^3)\) given by \(\omega = 3 e_1^*\) then we get that 
                \[
                    \star\omega = 3e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
                \]
                from the computation done above. Moreover we note that 
                \[
                    \omega \wedge \star\omega = 9e_1^* \wedge e_2^* \wedge e_3^*
                \]
                which happens to be \(\langle \omega, \omega\rangle\) if we identify 
                \[
                    ae_1^* + be_2^* + ce_3^* \mapsto 
                    \begin{pmatrix}
                        a \\
                        b \\
                        c

                \]
            </p>
        </div>

      </p>
          
          Building off of the last example let us look at the following example

      </p>

      <div id="container">
        <b>Example III</b>
            <p>
                If we are given \(\omega, \eta \in \Lambda^1(V^\ast)\) then note that \(\omega = \sum_{i}\omega_i \phi_i\) and 
                \(\eta = \sum_i \eta_i \phi_i\) then note that 
                \[
                    \star\eta = \sum_{i}(-1)^{i-1}\eta_i\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n
                \]
                So we have 
                \[
                  \begin{aligned}
                      \omega \wedge (\star\eta) &= \sum_{i}(-1)^{i-1}\omega_i\eta_i\,\phi_i \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi}_i \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n\\
                                                &= \sum_{i}\omega_i\eta_i\,\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\
                                                &= \langle \omega, \eta \rangle \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n 
                  \end{aligned}
                \]
                Given the same identification as in the example above. Moreover if \(\psi_i\) is another orthonormal basis
                from the same orientation as \(\phi_i\) we have the existence of some unit determiant linear map \(A\) such 
                that the map is described by \(A\psi_i = \phi_i\). This means that \(\omega_\psi = \omega_\phi\) where 
                these are the volume forms induced by each basis. This now shows that this property is independent of choice
                 of orthonormal basis.

    <h3>Extension of Inner Products to Tensor Spaces</h3>
    
      <p>
          The last example shows the need for an inner product. So suppose we now endow our vector space with an inner product
          \(g\). Now we want to find a way to extend this inner product to all tensor spaces associated to \(V\). We first 
          extend this to the dual space. First note that \(g\) we may treat this as a map 
          \(\hat{g}: V \to V\) given by \(\hat{g}(v) = \iota_vg\) and by the nondegeneracy we have that this is an isomorphism,
          as a slight nod to the <a href="../Linear Algebra/rieszRepresentation.html">Riesz Representation theorem</a>. 
      </p>

      <div id="container">
        <b>Theorem: Inner Product on Dual Space</b>
            <p>
                We may define an inner product on \(V^\ast\) as 
                \[
                    h(\varphi, \psi) = g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\psi))
                \]
            </p>
      </div>

       <div id="proof">
            Proof: We need to first show that this is bilinear, note that we will first show that it is linear in the first entry,
            then we will show it is symmetric which will then show that it is bilinear. So let \(\alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R}\)
            and let \(\varphi, \psi, \eta \in V^\ast\) then we compute
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    h(\alpha\varphi + \beta\psi, \eta)
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\alpha\varphi + \beta\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= g(\alpha\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi) + \beta\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= g(\alpha\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) + g(\beta\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= \alpha g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) + \beta g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\eta)) \\
                    &= \alpha h(\varphi, \eta) + \beta h(\psi, \eta)
                \end{align*}
            \]
            Next we show that this is symmetric, note that 
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    h(\varphi, \psi) 
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\psi)) \\
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\varphi)) \\
                    &= h(\psi, \varphi)
                \end{align*}
            \]
            hence we conclude that \(h\) is bilinear since 
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    h(\varphi, \alpha\psi + \beta\eta)
                    &= h(\alpha\psi + \beta\eta, \varphi) \\
                    &= \alpha h(\psi, \varphi) + \beta h(\eta, \varphi) \\
                    &= \alpha h(\varphi, \psi) + \beta h(\varphi, \eta) 
                \end{align*}
            \]
            Just as needed. Now we need to show that it is nondegenerate. Suppose \(\psi \in V^\ast\) is such that 
            \(h(\psi, \varphi) = 0\) for all \(\varphi \in V^\ast\). Then note that 
            \[
                \begin{align*}
                    0 
                    &= h(\psi, \psi) \\
                    &= g(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi), \hat{g}^{-1}(\psi))
                \end{align*}
            \]
            and but non degeneracy of \(g\) we have \(\hat{g}^{-1}(\psi) = 0\) which means that \(\psi = 0\) since 
            \(\hat{g}\) is an isomorphism. Hence \(h\) is an inner product on \(V^\ast\) just as we needed.
       </div>

       <p>
            Using this we can now extend the inner product on a vector space \(V\) to all its tensor products 
            \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V) = (V^\ast)^{\otimes k} \otimes V^{\otimes l}\). We will first extend them to decomposable tensors and then we
            extend it bilinearly to the entire tensor space.

        <b>Theorem: Inner Product on Tensor Spaces \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\)</b>
            <p>
                We may define an inner product on \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\) on decomposable tensors as 
                \[
                    \begin{align*}
                        \langle \varphi^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^k \otimes v_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes v_l&, 
                        \psi^1 \otimes \cdots \otimes \psi^k \otimes w_1 \otimes \cdots \otimes w_l \rangle \\
                        &= h(\varphi^1, \psi^1)\cdots h(\varphi^k, \psi^k)g(v_1, w_1) \cdots g(v_l, w_l)
                    \end{align*}
                \]
                and we then extend it to the rest of \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\) by bilinearity.
            </p>
      </div>

      <div id="proof">
        Proof: The bilinearity and the symmetry are trivial since it is built into the definition of the function. Now we will show that this is 
        nondegenerate. Note that any tensor is a sum of decomposable ones. Let \(e_1, \cdots, e_n\) be an orthonormal basis for \(V\) and let
        \(\varphi^1, \cdots, \varphi^n\) be the corresponding dual basis, meaning that \(\varphi^i(v) = g(v, e_i)\), with the isomorphism given by the inner product on \(V\). 
        Note that by the defintion of the inner product this is an orthonormal basis on \(V^\ast\). Now any \(f \in \mathcal{T}^k_l\) we have 
        \[
            f = f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}\varphi^{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{i_k} \otimes e_{j_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_l}
        \]
        then note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                0 &= \langle f, f\rangle \\
                  &= \langle f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}\varphi^{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{i_k} \otimes e_{j_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_l}, f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l} \varphi^{m_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{m_k} \otimes e_{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{n_l} \rangle \\
                  &= f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l}\langle \varphi^{i_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{i_k} \otimes e_{j_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{j_l}, \varphi^{m_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes \varphi^{m_k} \otimes e_{n_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes e_{n_l} \rangle \\
                  &= f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l}h(\varphi^{i_1}, \varphi^{m_1})\cdots h(\varphi^{i_k}, \varphi^{m_k})g(e_{j_1}, e_{n_1})\cdots g(e_{j_l}, e_{n_l}) \\
                  &= f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l}f_{m_1\cdots m_k}^{n_1\cdots n_l}\delta^{i_1m_1}\cdots \delta^{i_km_k}\delta_{j_1n_1}\cdots\delta_{j_ln_l} \\
                  &= (f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l})^2
            \end{align*}
        \]
        hence \(f_{i_1\cdots i_k}^{j_1\cdots j_l} = 0\) for all possible indices. This means that \(f = 0\). This makes the function as defined
        is an inner product on \(\mathcal{T}^k_l(V)\)
      </div>

      <p>
        With this, we note that the space of forms is a subspace of \(\mathcal{T}^k(V)\) and hence the inner product restricts to an inner product
        on the space of forms. But as it turns out, we want this inner product but scaled slightly. 
        We make use of the convention that 
        \[
            \omega \wedge \eta = \frac{(k+l)!}{k!l!}\text{Alt}(\omega \wedge \eta)
        \]
        With this we define the inner product on decomposable forms \(\omega^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \omega^k\) and 
        \(\eta^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \eta^k\) by 
        \[
            \langle \omega^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \omega^k, \eta^1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \eta^k \rangle 
            = \det(\langle \omega^i, \eta^j \rangle)
        \] 
        This now makes \(\Lambda^k(V^*)\) into an inner product space and hence we can define a Hodge star operator 
        as the operator such that 
        \[
            \omega \wedge \star\eta = \langle \omega, \eta\rangle\,\omega
        \]
        It now remains to show that this definition agrees with the definition given above.

        \]
        was defined to be the unique form \(\eta\) such that \(\phi_I \wedge \eta = \omega\). But note that 
        \[
            \star\phi_I = \eta = (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n

        and if \(\alpha = \alpha^{j_1\cdots j_k}\phi_{j_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{j_k}\) (here we are summing over 
        increasing sequences here). Note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                \alpha \wedge \star\phi_I 
                &= (-1)^{i_1 - 1}\cdots(-1)^{i_k - k}\alpha^{j_1\cdots j_k}\phi_{j_1}\wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_{j_k} \wedge \phi_1 \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_1}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \widehat{\phi_{i_k}} \wedge \cdots \wedge \phi_n \\

            \end{align*}
        \]
        here we used the fact that any other sequence of the \(j\)'s that are not \(I\) will have repeated one forms and 
        hence is \(0\). But this now means that the the two maps coincide since they are the same on a basis.

    <h2>Hodge Star Operator on Manifolds</h2>
        <p>
            Now that we have an inner product on the space of forms we can extend this idea fibrewise to the space of differential
            forms on manifolds. We do this in such a way that on each fibre the inner product is given by the formula we defined 
            above. Let us now extend the ideas from example III. For this, let \((M, g)\) be an oriented Riemannian manifold. Then we 
            have the existence of the canonical volume form \(\dd V_g\). 
        </p>

        <div id="container">
            <b>Theorem: Hodge Star Operator on Manifolds (Existence and Uniqueness)</b>
                <p>
                    There is a unique operator \(\star: \Lambda^kT^\ast M \to \Lambda^{n-k}T^\ast M\) such that 
                    \[
                        \omega \wedge \star\eta = \langle \omega, \eta\rangle\,\dd V_g
                    \]
                    for all \(\omega, \eta \in \Omega^k(M)\). It should be clear here that this operation is done pointwise,
                    hence it can be extended to the forms. Moreover this operator is a smooth bundle isomorphism.
                </p>
      </div>

      <div id="proof">
        Proof: Note that the existence of such an operator is already done since we extended the inner product space version of the 
        Hodge star to the fibres of \(\Lambda^kT^\ast M\). Moreover the uniqueness is also taken care of since the operator 
        is linear and hence is determined by its value on some basis. We can moreover resetrict to an orthonormal basis by
        multiplying through via a determinant that will be cancelled by the inverse determiant from the induced volume form.
        But as seen in each fibre, the value for an orthonormal basis is given as in the beginning lemma. It therefore
        remains to show that this map is smooth. But that is also taken care of since on any chart, this becomes the Hodge 
        star on \(\R^n\). But the components of \(\star\eta\) is a polynomial in the metric components and the components
        of \(\eta\). Hence the map is smooth. It is also a bundle isomorphism since it maps a fibre over a point into a 
        fibre over the same point. Moreover on each fibre it is an isomorphism.
      </div>

      <h2>Uses of the Hodge Star</h2>

      <p>
        The existence of the Hodge star is nice, but what does this really do for us? For one, this allows us to find a
        formula for the adjoint of the exterior derivative with respect to the inner product on forms given by 
        \[
            (\omega, \eta) = \int_M \langle \omega, \eta\rangle\,\dd V_g
        \]
        So we restrict ourselves to compact orientable manifolds for this. With this setup we now want to find the 
        (formal) adjoint for \(\dd: \Omega^k(M) \to \Omega^{k+1}(M)\) with respect to this inner product. To find this 
        formula we just do a direct computation. One thing we need to note is that \((-1)^{k} = (-1)^{-k}\) for all \(k\).
        Armed with this we compute 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                (\omega, \dd\eta)
                &= \int_M \langle \omega, \eta\rangle\,\dd V_g \\
                &= \int_M \dd\eta \wedge \star \omega 
            \end{align*}
        \]
        Since \(\langle \omega, \eta\rangle\,\dd V_g\) is a top form, it is closed. This means that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                0 
                &= \dd(\langle \omega, \eta\rangle\,\dd V_g) \\
                &= \dd(\eta \wedge \star\omega) \\
                &= \dd\eta \wedge \star\omega + (-1)^{k-1}\eta \wedge (\dd\star\omega) 
            \end{align*}
        \]
        giving us \((-1)^k\eta \wedge (\dd\star\omega) = (-1)^{k-2}\eta \wedge (\dd\star\omega) = \dd\eta \wedge \star\omega\)
        hence 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                (\omega, \dd\eta)
                &= \int_M \dd\eta \wedge \star \omega \\
                &= (-1)^{k}\int_{M}\eta \wedge (\dd \star\omega) \\
                &= (-1)^{k}(-1)^{(n-k+1)(k-1)} \int_{M}\eta \wedge (\star\star\dd \star\omega) \\
                &= (-1)^{k}(-1)^{(n-k+1)(k-1)} \int_M \langle \eta, \star\dd\star\omega\rangle\,\dd V_g \\
                &= (-1)^{k}(-1)^{(n-k+1)(k-1)} (\star\dd\star\omega, \eta)
            \end{align*}
        \]
        Now the prefactor is given by 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                (-1)^{k}(-1)^{(n-k+1)(k-1)}
                &= (-1)^{k + nk - n - k^2 + k + k - 1} \\
                &= (-1)^{3k}(-1)^{nk - n + 1}(-1)^{k^2} \\
                &= (-1)^k(-1)^{nk - n + 1}(-1)^{k^2 - k} \\
                &= (-1)^{nk + n + 1} \\
                &= (-1)^{n(k+1) + 1}
            \end{align*}
        \]
        here we made use of the fact that \(k^2 - k\) is the product of consective integrers and hence is even. Moreover 
        we used \((-1)^n = (-1)^{-n}\). This means that the adjoint of \(\dd\) is the operator 
        \(\dd^\ast = (-1)^{n(k+1) + 1}\star\dd\star\). Since this is the adjoint we note that
        \(\dd^\ast: \Omega^{k}(M) \to \Omega^{k-1}(M)\). Moreover note that 
        \[
            \begin{align*}
                (\dd^\ast\dd^\ast\omega, \eta)
                &= (\omega, \dd\dd\eta) \\
                &= 0
            \end{align*}
        \]
        hence \((\dd^\ast)^2 = 0\). Using this we define the operator 
        \(\Delta = (\dd + \dd^\ast)^2 = \dd\dd^\ast + \dd^\ast\dd\), this is called the Laplace-Beltrami operator.
